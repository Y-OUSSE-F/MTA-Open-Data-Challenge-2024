# MTA-Open-Data-Challenge-2024

For the Metropolitan Transit Authority's (MTA) 2024 Data Challenge, (New York City's public transport agency) I wanted to put together something simple to help me understand more about the city that I love. Hence for this project, I was truly interested to learn more about the volume of people that the MTA moves on a daily basis. Making use of the following dataset: [MTA Subway Hourly Ridership: Beginning February 2022](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-202/wujg-7c2s/about_data), I broke down how New York City moved since the start of 2024.

If you are interested, the notebook used to put the visuals together and manipulate my data can be found in this repo : )
